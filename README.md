# Node-Blog

A simple blog site made using node.js using a tutorial from Net Ninja


## (extra things) To-Do (once finished the tutorial)

### function
- add author property to blog model
- show date blog was created on site

### form
- change css (learn css proper, find good pics, get inspo)
- make footer n nav bar nicer
- make 404 page nicer

## random long term ideas

- have comments on blogs (disqus mayb?)
- polls?
- categories on blogs?
- users with auth????  (MASSIVE if)
